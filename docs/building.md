# Building (WIP - THIS ARTICLE IS INCOMPLETE)

It is recommended you rename the file to ```Vitrix-(version)-(OS).(extension)```. Be sure to replace the ```(version)``` with the actual version, ```(OS)``` with the OS it is built for and ```(extension)``` with the filename extension. If you have any problems with the build process, please create an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/ShadityZ/Vitrix/issues).
