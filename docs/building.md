# Building (WIP - THIS ARTICLE IS INCOMPLETE)

Building will allow you create portable binaries for your operating system, essentially apps that don't require python installed to run.

### NOTE: At the moment, only Linux is supported. Windows and MacOS support will be coming soon.

Building Vitrix is really easy, as there is a script to automate all of it! Simply run:

```
python3 build.py
```

If you have any problems with the build process, please create an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/ShadityZ/Vitrix/issues).
