# Learning to play Vitrix

Vitrix uses the common layout of many video games, so anyone coming from other games shouldn't have a very hard time adapting to Vitrix's controls.
Vitrix itself doesn't have a controls setting menu just yet, but the feature is coming very soon. Here is a table of Vitrix's controls:


| **Control**  |                                                  **Description**                                                   |
|:------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| WASD         | This is the main movement pad. W to walk forward, A to strafe left, S to walk backward and D to  strafe right.     |
| Spacebar     | The spacebar is used to make your character jump.                                                                  |
| Tab _or_ Esc | The tab key helps you escape the mouse grab, freeing your cursor to let you close the window, or do other things.  |
| Left-click   | The left mouse button is binded to the function of shooting, using your gun.                                       |
| L            | The L key is a control specific to singleplayer. It summons a Zombie, that chases and attacks you, draining health!|

Obviously, just learning the controls isn't enough. You also need to learn to use strategies and learn to act smart on the battlefield, however, I'll leave that to you. 

Happy learning!
